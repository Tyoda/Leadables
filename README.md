# Leadables
A Wurm Unlimited server-side mod to make any of the default creatures leadable or not leadable.

This mod was inspired by <a href="https://forum.wurmonline.com/index.php?/topic/184858-allow-hitching-on-tower-guards-spirit-templars/">this forum  suggestion</a>!

## Fun things to do
 - Make guards leadable, have your personal army!
 - Make Bartender leadable! Following Free Food!
 - Make dragons leadable! Well...actually...they'd follow you home anyway...
 
 
## How to
Just uncomment the lines with the creatures whose leadabilty you want to change and set it to true/false!
If you want to set all guards to be leadable, your .properties file should look like this:
```properties
